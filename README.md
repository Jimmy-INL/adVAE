PyTorch implementation of paper: "adVAE: a Self-adversarial Variational Autoencoder with Gaussian Anomaly Prior Knowledge for Anomaly Detection".

The file "self_adVAE-test.ipynb" shows the results of adVAE. Until now, we have only uploaded some code to show the performance of the adVAE model. The whole code is coming soon...
