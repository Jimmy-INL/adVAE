# About datasets
Letter, cardio, opticaldigts and pen datasets is available in [ODDS library](http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/).
Satellite dataset can be download in [Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Benchmark](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/OPQMVF).


# The whole code is coming soon...

PyTorch implementation of paper: "adVAE: a Self-adversarial Variational Autoencoder with Gaussian Anomaly Prior Knowledge for Anomaly Detection".

The file "self_adVAE-test.ipynb" shows the results of adVAE. Until now, we have only uploaded some code to show the performance of the adVAE model. The whole code is coming soon...
